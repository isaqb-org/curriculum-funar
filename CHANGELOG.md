# Release Notes
## 2023.1 Release

As compared with the 2018.1 release, the curriculum has been
substantially reorganized, albeit without substantial changes to the
set of covered topics.  This was done based on the experience gained
from teaching the curriculum.

The goals here were:

- Reduce the sheer amount of material, as 2018.1 was too much to cover
  in three days.
- Specifically, remove mention of DSLs, as there is now an Advanced
  curriculum on DSLs.
- Better align the curriculum with a proven didactic flow.
- Fit the current Advanced curriculum template, specifically introduce
  explicit Learning Goals.

Specifically:

- The "System Structure" section was retitled "Basics of functional
  programming", and the material on data modeling was fleshed out.
- The "Technologies" section is much as it was.
- The section on "Non-Functional Requirements" was largely removed for
  reasons of space, except for the mention of events in the new
  section on "Functional Macro Architecture".
- The sections on "Functional Requirements" and "Architectural
  Patterns" were re-organized into the new sections "Functional
  Modeling" and "Functional Macro Architecture".
